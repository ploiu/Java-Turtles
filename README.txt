===============================
the above was a (slightly modified for privacy's sake) letter I wrote to my AP comp sci teacher when I was a senior in high school.
The specific language was java, and the turtle library my teacher found was pretty bad so I decided to write my own and send it to her after I graduated. 
This was the first big project I did for a specific person, and I can't believe I still had this code after all this time. I decided to share this code 
in the hopes that new programmers who want to try their hand at some turtles can find this useful.
